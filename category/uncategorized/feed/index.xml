<p id="f425">Remember using the initial version of Microsoft PowerPoint back in the 1990s? It was fun back then,&nbsp;especially when we tried to do slide animations! Years passed and so many multimedia tools were introduced to the public. For creating high-quality animations and other content, vendors like Adobe, Corel etc are ruling the world now. However, for the majority of people, PowerPoint is still a useful tool for creating professional slides. Even though PowerPoint is trying to regain its might in the recent years, people continue to make use of the same old set of basic features they used 10 years ago. This article mainly intends to highlight the remarkable efforts of Microsoft in improving the software. The article also aims to provide the information concisely without having to read too much.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Video Export — Create Title Card for Premiere Pro!</strong></li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*wVOZXQ28W2X44k7pyEhN2Q.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p id="7def">For video editors, tools like premiere pro can offer easy solutions to cut, trim and join videos. However, if you need a good looking animated title card, it is still a tedious task manually animating using the timeline. With the video export feature in PowerPoint, now one can easily export professional looking animations as a video which can be embedded/included in other tools! A very useful feature for content creators!</p>



<p id="67a1"><strong>2. Remove background — Improved Look and Feel!</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*2kYSWjmoMJ09iGVfdzCFmw.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p id="16e8">Earlier, we had to take images out of PowerPoint for making edit operations like remove background, recolor, invert etc. Now, these features built-in, we can make our slides beautiful and consistent in just a few clicks! Learn commands from above image and try it out!</p>



<p id="8066"><strong>3. Morph Transition — The best among transitions!</strong></p>



<p id="839e">This is a feature that is reserved only for Microsoft 365 subscribers and PowerPoint 2019 users. Try out this transition if you</p>



<p id="11e0"><strong>4. Vector Graphics — No need to search internet for vector icons!</strong></p>



<p>Check out the <strong><em>Insert &#8211;> icons</em></strong> section. They are amazing and just rich in categorized vector icons. Check it out! Believe it or not!, you can copy paste them in other vector editing software as well!</p>



<p id="da1f"><strong>5. 3D Objects — Import and Interact with 3D objects!</strong></p>



<p>This is a great advancement that PowerPoint now supports loading and showing standard 3D formats like wavefront OBJ, GLTF etc. While in presentation mode, you can even interact with those 3D models. Try out the <strong><em>Insert -> 3D models</em> </strong>option.</p>



<p id="bf52"><strong>6. Slide Loop — Show slides in a continuous loop!</strong></p>



<p>This is a very useful feature for running public shows, conferences where you are sometimes required to run slides on screen in a continuous loop. You can get a simple explanation of how to do it from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-loop-a-powerpoint?r=US&amp;IR=T">https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-loop-a-powerpoint?r=US&amp;IR=T</a></p>



<p id="b145"><strong>7. Zoom — A Prezi like feature!</strong></p>



<p>This reminds me of an old tool named Prezi. This features takes your presentations to a next level. Read more from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-zoom-for-powerpoint-to-bring-your-presentation-to-life-9d6c58cd-2125-4d29-86b1-0097c7dc47d7" data-type="URL" data-id="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-zoom-for-powerpoint-to-bring-your-presentation-to-life-9d6c58cd-2125-4d29-86b1-0097c7dc47d7">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-zoom-for-powerpoint-to-bring-your-presentation-to-life-9d6c58cd-2125-4d29-86b1-0097c7dc47d7</a></p>

<p id="4e39">MATLAB is a very useful high-level language and interactive environment that enables us to do computationally intensive tasks. Since it is an interpreted language, there are performance issues. However, we are blessed with huge libraries and toolboxes which will ease our complex mathematical computations. We can also make GUI applications in MATLAB using its GUI builder. The GUI toolbox in MATLAB only provides a few set of controls in it.</p>



<p id="5f14">Most of us refrain from using&nbsp;languages like C or C++ as compared to MATLAB because of the lack of libraries which is available in MATLAB. In this tutorial, I will show you how to call the MATLAB functions from C#.NET code with useful examples. Similar tutorials are available online, but this one is focused at handling images.</p>



<p id="75a1">This tutorial explains the following</p>



<p id="a0cd">1. Calling a simple MATLAB function and fetching the result in .NET.</p>



<p id="5a71">2. Processing Images using MATLAB function.</p>



<p id="3276"><strong>1. Calling a simple MATLAB function and fetching the result in .NET.</strong></p>



<p id="6a52">Let us do a simple matrix addition for a start.</p>



<ol><li>Create a MATLAB function with the code for matrix addition.</li></ol>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function [ c ] = addMatrices( a,b )
c=a+b; %add the matrices.
end</pre>



<p id="0d22">2. Type “deploytool” in the Command Window of MATLAB which will display.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/431/1*v-J_Tf9_ALuhj6-JKQXZFg.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p id="5df0">3. Type a project name in the Name field and select the Target as “.NET Assembly” and press the OK button.</p>



<p id="0304">4. Now the deployment tool will be shown and in the Deployment Tool, select the Build tab and add a class “MyMatClass”. Add our MATLAB function addMatrices to the class. The created class with the function will look like</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/301/1*cx_DwP74gM7uGUMHXAhUVg.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p id="3f8c">5. Click on the build icon in the Deployment Tool to start deploying the .NET component.</p>



<p id="d435">6. Upon successful deployment, you will get the dll files generated and you can find them under the Package tab. We only need the MatCode.dll file in .NET</p>



<p id="293e">7. You should have MCR (MATLAB Compiler Runtime) installed in your machine and there is no need to install MATLAB. Next Step is to add the required References in .NET. The following are the two dll files required by the C#.NET project to invoke the MATLAB functions.</p>



<p id="6b6d">(a) MatCode.dll</p>



<p id="c8de">(b)MWArray.dll (this file can located in the MCR installed directory , something like ….\MATLAB Compiler Runtime\v713\toolbox\dotnetbuilder\bin\win32\v2.0)</p>



<p id="7784">After adding these two references to the C#.NET project, you are ready to code.</p>



<p id="554d">The following is a code in C# that declares two matrices and passes them to a MATLAB function for adding.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/296/1*GPQQFgB1slF145so52MxLw.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">int[,] a ={ { 1, 2, 3 }, { 4, 5, 6 }, { 7, 8, 9 } }; //Matrix 1
int[,] b ={ { 1, 2, 3 }, { 4, 5, 6 }, { 7, 8, 9 } }; //Matrix 2
MWNumericArray arr1 = a;
MWNumericArray arr2 = b;
MyMatClass obj = new MyMatClass();
MWArray result = obj.addMatrices((MWArray)arr1, (MWArray)arr2);
Debug.WriteLine(result);  //Result is displayed</pre>



<p id="66ea">Following are the extra namespaces that are to be added.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">using MathWorks.MATLAB.NET.Arrays;
using MatCode;</pre>



<p id="ba25">The MCR will be handling the execution of MATLAB code and the results are returned to our C# program. MWArray.dll encapsulates the different types of data that enable communication between .NET and MATLAB.</p>



<p id="56d9"><strong>2. Processing Images using MATLAB function.</strong></p>



<p id="c44e">Processing images is not simple as the matrix addition. Sometimes we may fall short of functions in C# to process images. In C#, we have other libraries like Aforge to enable image processing. However, we can say that Aforge library do not cover as much functions as MATLAB does. For example, in MATLAB we can apply different type of noise to image like sale &amp; pepper, Gaussian, speckle noise etc. Aforge provides a method for adding salt &amp; pepper noise to the image. But there is no method in Aforge that apply a speckle noise to the image. In such cases we still want to rely upon MATLAB.</p>



<p id="667b">The following code snippets that I wrote will help in processing of images in C# with the help of MATLAB. I will explain how to read an image in C# and pass it to MATLAB for processing. After processing the image, the MATLAB code will return the processed image back to C#.</p>



<p id="29f7">Here we go…</p>



<p id="fc3a">Following a code in MATLAB function that apply salt &amp; pepper noise to an image.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function [output_image] = applyNoise(input_image)
output_image=imnoise(input_image,'salt &amp; pepper',0.5);
end</pre>



<p id="2ebd">Now the function is packaged in a dll file as explained before.</p>



<p id="fcb6">The following are the steps in short that is to be done in C#.NET</p>



<p id="0e21">1. Read an image into a Bitmap object.</p>



<p id="af47">2. Read the image pixels using getPixel method and place the pixel values in a 3D array of UInt16 (Unsigned integer).</p>



<p id="163a">3. Call MATLAB function and fetch the results in MWArray object.</p>



<p id="f81c">4. Read the output array and set the output pixels accordingly.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">int i, j;
Bitmap image = (Bitmap)pictureBox1.Image;
int width = image.Width;
int height = image.Height;
Bitmap processed_image = new Bitmap(width, height);
try
{
byte[, ,] rgb = new byte[3, height, width];
for (i = 0; i &lt; height; i++)
{
for (j = 0; j &lt; width; j++)
{
rgb[0,i,j] = image.GetPixel(j, i).R;
rgb[1,i,j] = image.GetPixel(j, i).G;
rgb[2,i,j] = image.GetPixel(j, i).B;
}
}
MWNumericArray narr = rgb;
MyMatClass obj = new MyMatClass();
MWArray u =obj.applyFixedNoise((MWArray)narr);
for (i = 0; i &lt; height; i++)
{
for (j = 0; j &lt; width; j++)
{
processed_image.SetPixel(j,i, Color.FromArgb(Convert.ToInt32(u[i + 1, j + 1, 1].ToString()), Convert.ToInt32(u[i + 1, j + 1, 2].ToString()), Convert.ToInt32(u[i + 1, j+ 1, 3].ToString())));
}
}
pictureBox2.Image = processed_image;
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
Debug.Print(ex.Message);
}</pre>



<p id="9d40">Following is a sample result obtained</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/703/1*unbYJi4fT6HjCEFmPbL0hQ.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p id="1810">It is to be noted that the above snippet is specially written for RGB images. Doing the same for grayscale images is very easier than this.</p>



<p id="c355">Happy Coding…</p>

<p>As I write this article on edge detection kernels, there are already several materials available online that explain those. The intent of this article is to provide a good coverage of edge detection methods, and to explain the concepts in simpler terms.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>WHAT IS EDGE DETECTION?</p></blockquote>



<p id="9546">Edge detection is a technique used in image processing that&nbsp;helps in finding object boundaries within images. The key behind edge detection is all about detecting discontinuities in pixel intensities (brightness). This technique is mainly used in applications like feature extraction. This article is explaining edge detection using 2D images does not imply that the technique is limited to 2D alone. It is important to note that edge detection can be done on 1D, 2D or 3D.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>WHY DO WE NEED EDGE DETECTION?</p></blockquote>



<p id="7b14">As we know, edges are boundaries that we see in images and they help in distinguishing one object from another. Extracting or detecting those boundaries has got several applications. Concrete areas that use edge detection include self-driving vehicles that use computer vision to understand environment, robotics vision, finding boundaries in medical images, license plate detection, ,matching finger prints, etc. It is also important to note that edges are fundamental features of an image that useful for feature description, segmentation, enhancement, restoration, data compression and pattern analysis.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>HOW IT WORKS?</p></blockquote>



<p id="39d3">The basic idea of edge detection involves looking for a neighborhood where the data changes. Obviously, the concerns here include size of the neighborhood and deciding a metric that represents the change. Maybe we can use a simple threshold.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*CDRp2PMQ0wWBLAOM" alt=""/></figure>



<p id="9de4">As shown in Figure 1, edge detection methods can be broadly classified into gradient based and Laplacian based. For an easy comprehension, I have depicted the difference between these two approaches visually inside the dotted circles at either side of the image. Gradient-based approaches looks for maxima/minima in the first derivative of the image for identifying edges. On the other hand, Laplacian based approaches work based on the second derivative and looks for zero crossings.</p>

<p>Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) is a widely accessed open source software used in machine learning tasks. Weka, being an open source software, we are allowed to modify its source to create an entirely new weka distribution with a new set of classifiers or other features.</p>



<p id="163e">I am not covering any further in the basics of weka. This tutorial is intended for those who want to integrate a new classifier algorithm written in java into the weka software. For demonstration purposes, I am showing the procedure to add ART(Adaptive Resonance Theory), a neural network based classifier to Weka.</p>



<p id="b065"><strong>Required Tools</strong></p>



<p id="af8a">You need the following before you start the integration process.</p>



<p id="062c">JDK</p>



<p id="c2cf">Weka</p>



<p id="60ba">ANT</p>



<p id="a70f">You need the JDK (Java Development Kit) for compiling the updated/modified weka source packages. The installation folder of Weka would contain the weka source code archive, which we will be modifying to create a new distribution of weka. ANT is a command line tool and a java library used for building java applications.</p>



<p id="4f86">Step 1: Create a folder “weka” in&nbsp;<strong>C:\</strong></p>



<p id="56e1">Step 2: Go to the weka installation folder and Extract the contents of weka-src.jar to&nbsp;<strong>C:\weka</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*3M0KNtLsekIfcQa5Ut1KCQ.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*hZRQ0-2jGaDhDtovHVo5yQ.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p id="fa61">Step 3: Go to&nbsp;<strong>C:\weka\src\main\java\weka\gui</strong></p>



<p id="b61e">Step 4: Open the file GenericObjectEditor.props in any editor for editing.</p>



<p id="d515">Step 5: The file GenericObjectEditor.props is like a configuration file used by weka. In this file we are going to add a line that declares that a new classifier named “Artmap” should be displayed in the classifier tab of Weka GUI. We need to add an entry corresponding to our new classifier in the “List of Classifiers” section of the file. The addition of the new entry should follow an alphabetical order of classifier name. In the following example, line number 6 indicates our new entry.</p>



<p id="fd2e">Step 6: Now we can add the source code of the new classifier. In this example, I have two source files (of same classifier);&nbsp;<strong>Artmap.java</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>ArtmapConstants.java</strong></p>



<p id="221e">We can add them to the source folders; in this example we are adding to the folder&nbsp;<strong>C:\weka\src\main\java\weka\classifiers\bayes</strong></p>



<p id="b611">Step 7: We need to download ANT from the following website</p>



<p id="2b05"><a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi</a>&nbsp;and then extract the contents to C:\ant</p>



<p id="4aa2">Step 8: Create a batch file&nbsp;<strong>weka.bat</strong>&nbsp;with the following content</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">set ANT_HOME=C:\antset JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.6set PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bincd \cd weka</pre>



<p id="bad6">We created this bat file for an easy build process. As you can see in its contents, we are setting the PATH to make the path of java and ANT globally known to the computer.</p>



<p id="83f7">Step 9: Run Command Prompt.</p>



<p id="25ea">Step 10: Navigate to C:\ and then execute the batch file weka.bat</p>



<p id="cb4d">Step 11: Type the following in the Command Prompt to start the build process.</p>



<p id="83ed">Step 12: If you had all set correctly you will get a “BUILD SUCCEEDED” message at the end.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/504/1*TCo1KYogP7hXNfOq8vf7EA.png" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p id="dcb6">Step 13: Your new Weka distribution will be created in a new folder&nbsp;<strong>C:\weka\dist&nbsp;</strong>and you can start the executable jar created which should have your new classifier integrated</p>
